# Project: Synthetic Training Data for Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

## General Instructions:
- When implementing a new feature, write new test cases or update the existing ones
- When implementing a new feature, write documentation in ./docs by creating new .md files or updating existing ones
- This application is specifically build to not make assumptions about the lanaguge. It needs to function for all possible writing styles, directions, and glyfs. 
 

## Coding Style:
- Add a Google-style docstring and PEP 484 type hints to new and refactored Python functions
- Where possible, use Test Driven Development practice to develop new features.
- When Test Driven Development is not practical, consider writing new test cases or updating existing test cases before implementing the feature 

## Regarding Dependencies:
- Built-in python libraries are fine to add but avoid introducing new external dependencies unless there is a need. 
- If a new dependency is required, confirm with the user
- After a new python dependency is confirmed, add it to ./requirements.txt
- After a new system dependency is confirmed, add it to ./Dockerfile
